## Introduction

CineColorAI aims to simplify and enhance the color grading process. By combining intelligent image analysis with intuitive controls, users can unlock new creative possibilities and achieve cinematic visuals with ease.  Currently powered by ResNet50, we are actively developing our own custom-trained AI model for even more nuanced and personalized color grading.

## Features

- **Seamless Image Input:** Drag and drop images for instant analysis.
- **Intelligent Visual Profiling:** Detailed analysis of dominant colors, color harmony, dynamic range, composition, and more.
- **Interactive LUT Creation Studio:** Design custom LUTs tailored to your aesthetic vision.
- **LUT Export:** Export LUTs in the industry-standard .cube format.
- **Base64 Stream Access:** Integrate adjusted images into web applications via Base64 streams.
- **AI-Augmented Analysis:** Leverage ResNet50 for feature extraction and pattern recognition. (Transitioning to a custom AI model soon!)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Image Processing:** PIL (Pillow), OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-image, SciPy
- **AI Engine:** PyTorch, TorchVision (ResNet50, future custom model)
- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript
- **Image Optimization:** WebP


## Roadmap

- **Custom AI Model:** Develop and integrate a custom-trained AI model for more precise and personalized color grading.  This will be the core focus.
- **Real-time Processing:** Explore options for real-time image and video processing.
- **Expanded LUT Library:** Provide a curated library of pre-made LUTs.
- **User Accounts:** Implement user authentication and personalized profiles.
- **Cloud Integration:** Offer cloud-based processing and storage.
- **API Access:** Create a public API for integration with other applications.
- **Video Support:** Extend functionality to include video color grading.

## Improvements

- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize image processing and AI inference for faster results.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improve the user interface and user experience based on user feedback.  Consider more interactive elements.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
- **Documentation:** Improve code documentation and create user guides.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is fully responsive on mobile devices.
- **Accessibility:**  Improve accessibility for users with disabilities.
